# FastHF - Amir Said's Huffman coding library, example code, and documentation

This is a clone of Amir Said's "FastHF" Huffman coding example. It's a very educational, high quality library, which I studied before creating LZHAM.

It's from his web page (which has been down for years now):

His Arithmetic coding example (FastAC) is [here](https://github.com/richgel999/FastAC).

"FastHF: Static and Adaptive Huffman Coding

We decided to also make the source code of our C++ implementation of Huffman coding publicly available for education. Its design objectives and interface (and documentation) are very similar to FastAC. Thus, except for the lack of binary coders, porting from one to the other should be quite easy. In addition, they are completely independent, i.e., both can be used in the same compression program."
